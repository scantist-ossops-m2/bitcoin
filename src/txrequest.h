/** Data structure to keep track of, and schedule, transaction downloads from peers.
 *
 * === Specification ===
 *
 * We keep track of which peers have announced which transactions, and use that to determine which requests
 * should go to which peer, when, and in what order.
 *
 * The following information is tracked per peer/tx combination ("announcement"):
 * - Which peer announced it (through their NodeId)
 * - The txid or wtxid of the transaction (collectively called "txhash" in what follows)
 * - Whether it was a tx or wtx announcement (see BIP339).
 * - What the earliest permitted time is that that transaction can be requested from that peer (called "reqtime").
 * - Whether it's from a "preferred" peer or not. Which announcements get this flag is determined by the caller, but
 *   this is designed for outbound peers, or other peers that we have a higher level of trust in). Even when the
 *   peers' preferredness changes, the preferred flag of existing announcements from that peer won't change.
 * - Whether or not the transaction was requested already, and if so, when it times out (called "expiry").
 * - Whether or not the transaction request failed already (timed out, or NOTFOUND was received).
 *
 * Transaction requests are then assigned to peers, following these rules:
 *
 * - No transaction is requested as long as another request for the same txhash is outstanding (it needs to fail
 *   first by passing expiry, or a NOTFOUND or invalid transaction has to be received for it).
 *
 *   Rationale: to avoid wasting bandwidth on multiple copies of the same transaction.
 *
 * - The same transaction is never requested twice from the same peer, unless the transaction was forgotten in
 *   between (see next point), and re-announced.
 *
 *   Rationale: giving a peer multiple chances to announce a transaction would allow them to bias requests in their
 *              favor, worsening invblock attacks. The flip side is that as long as an attacker manages to prevent
 *              us from receiving a transaction, failed announcements (including those from honest peers) will
 *              linger longer, increasing memory usage somewhat. The impact of this is limited by imposing a cap on
 *              the number of tracked announcements per peer.
 *              Invblocking is the practice of announcing transactions but not answer requests for them, in order
 *              to delay (or prevent) a target learning the transaction. See
 *              https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/miller2015topology.pdf for more information.
 *
 * - Announcements are only forgotten about when the peer that announced them went offline, when the transaction
 *   was received successfully, or when no candidates for a transaction remain that haven't been tried already.
 *
 *   Rationale: we need to eventually forget announcements to keep memory bounded, but as long as viable
 *              candidate peers remain, we prefer to avoid fetching from failed ones. As every request has a finite
 *              timeout and we schedule new request as soon a previous one expired, there is always progress being
 *              made towards forgetting a transaction - either successfully or unsuccessfully.
 *
 * - Transactions are not requested from a peer until its reqtime has passed.
 *
 *   Rationale: enable net_processing code to define a delay for less-than-ideal peers, so that (presumed) better
 *              peers have a chance to give their announcement first.
 *
 * - If multiple viable candidate peers exist according to the above rules, pick a peer as follows:
 *
 *   - If any preferred peers are available, non-preferred peers are not considered for what follows.
 *
 *     Rationale: preferred peers (outbound, whitelisted) are chosen by us, so are less likely to be under attacker
 *                control.
 *
 *   - Pick a uniformly random peer among the candidates.
 *
 *     Rationale: random assignments are hard to influence for attackers.
 *
 * Together these rules strike a balance between being fast in non-adverserial conditions and minimizing
 * susceptibility to invblock attacks. An attacker that races the network:
 * - Will be unsuccessful if all preferred connections are honest (and there is at least one).
 * - If there are P preferred connections of which Ph>=1 are honest, the attacker can delay us from learning
 *   about a transaction by k expiration periods, where k ~ 1 + NHG(N=P-1,K=P-Ph-1,r=1), which has mean
 *   P/(Ph+1) (where NHG stands for Negative Hypergeometric distribution). The "1 +" is due to the fact that the
 *   attacker can be the first to announce through a preferred connection in this scenario, which very likely means
 *   they get the first request.
 * - If all P preferred connections are to the attacker, and there are NP non-preferred connections of which NPh are
 *   honest, k ~ P + NHG(N=NP-1,K=NP-NPh-1,r=1), with mean P - 1 + NP/(NPh+1).
 *
 * Complexity:
 * - Memory usage is proportional to the total number of tracked announcements (Size()) plus the number of
 *   peers with a nonzero number of tracked announcements.
 * - CPU usage is generally logarithmic in the total number of tracked announcements, plus the number of
 *   announcements affected by an operation (amortized O(1) per announcement).
